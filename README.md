# Home Assistant Blueprints

Reusable Home Assistant blueprints for UniFi Protect doorbells, Sonos, and Google TTS.

## Included blueprints

### UniFi Doorbell -> Sonos Google Announcement (Sync)

Best option for multi-room sync. Sends one announcement call to all selected Sonos players with one shared volume.

File:
- `automation/sonos-doorbell/unifi_doorbell_sonos_google_announce_sync.yaml`

### UniFi Doorbell -> Sonos Google Announcement (Per Speaker Volume)

Lets you assign a different announcement volume to each Sonos player. This can be slightly less synchronized because Home Assistant sends the announcement one speaker at a time.

File:
- `automation/sonos-doorbell/unifi_doorbell_sonos_google_announce_per_speaker.yaml`
